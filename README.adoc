== LinkOpenBot ==

A Discord selfbot that lets you open links from stock notification servers...

To get this to work, you need a few things:

1) A Config.json file that details how you want LinkOpenBot to open links [TODO this will be added soon]
2) A Discord selfbot (its token) 

... I'm not responsible if your Discord selfbot account gets suspendedâ€”selfbotting is against the Discord TOS, or so I think. Either way, don't blame me.
